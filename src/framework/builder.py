"""
Builder state-machine: dependency-driven construction over an event-driven runtime.

This module implements a small, non-blocking state machine that coordinates building
a single artifact for a single provided target, after collecting its prerequisites.

Each builder instance declares:
- provides: the single target it can produce
- requires: the prerequisite target(s) it depends on

Lifecycle and event protocol:
- Incoming: resolve(target)
  A request to obtain an artifact for the provided target.
- Outgoing to prerequisites: resolve(require_i)
  When a builder accepts a resolve for what it provides, it fans out resolve events
  for each prerequisite it requires.
- Incoming from prerequisites: built(target=..., to=self, artifact=...)
  Prerequisite builders reply with built events addressed back to the requester.
- Internal trigger to self: build(target, prerequisites)
  Once all prerequisites are collected, the builder posts exactly one internal build event to
  itself to execute the build in its own executor.
- Internal: ready(target, artifact)
  After build completes, the builder posts exactly one ready to itself to transition to ready state.
- Outgoing responses: built(target, artifact, to=requestor)
  When ready (either immediately or after transitioning), respond to any resolve requests
  with built.

Concurrency model:
- Each builder runs within the AbstractProcessorâ€™s single-threaded executor, so state
  mutations and transitions are serialized per instance. No explicit locking is needed.

RSVP handling:
- Resolve requests that arrive before the artifact is ready are queued (RSVP). When the
  artifact becomes ready, the queue is drained by emitting built to each requestor in FIFO order.

Notes:
- The builder() decorator helps declare single-provide builders. The cache argument
  is currently not used; it is reserved for future extension.
  TODO: Evaluate wiring the cache parameter into a caching policy (e.g., memoization,
  invalidation) or remove if not needed.

Potential extensions:
- Support multiple provided targets and/or per-target artifacts
- Incremental builds or invalidation/cancellation of ongoing work
- De-duplication of duplicate resolve requests while a build is in-flight
- Robustness around missing/unexpected built events and error propagation
